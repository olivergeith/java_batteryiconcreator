<h2 pbzloc="138">&nbsp;Custom Battery Icon-Sets</h2>

<hr /> What are we doing here ?
<hr />
<p>This is the right place, if you have battery icons from somewhere (internet, self-designed...) and want to add them to your flashable-zip!<br />
<b>Attention don&#39;t add rendered battery icons from &quot;Render-Tab&quot; too...you will probably get an error trying to create the zip! Because of duplicate filenames!</b><br />
You will find some predefined Battery-IconSets here, but you can add your own IconSets as well!<br />
The predefined Icon-Sets are for AOKP Rom&#39;s and will probably not work on Stock Rom&#39;s!</p>

<p><i>There is no guaranty that the predefined icons match your ROM. You need to analyse your <b>SystemUI.apk</b> first, to make sure the icons match the naming in your ROM! </i></p>

<p>Make sure you have the correct Rom Settings before you create a flashable-zip!</p>

<h3>HowTo add your own IconSets:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Goto the folder where you extracted the &quot;Rom Fumbler&quot;</li>
	<li>Find the subfolder <strong>./batteries/</strong></li>
	<li>See the predefined IconSets in there ?</li>
	<li>Create a new subfolder(s) next to the predefined IconSets. For example &quot;CoolBattery&quot;</li>
	<li>and place your custom png&#39;s in that new folder.</li>
	<li>That is all&hellip;after a restart of the Rom Fumbler you should see your IconSet in the dropdown box.</li>
	<li><b>Hint: </b>The Rom Fumbler will create an overview-png automaticly in your new subfolder on restart<br />
	(if you want to show of your creations ?)</li>
	<li><b>Hint: </b>So if you want to stay flexible it might be a good idea to put xhdpi icons in here, even if you are on a hdpi ROM.<br />
	(icons are resized to fit your ROM-Presets!)</li>
	<li><b>Hint: </b>If you create your own IconSet, it might be a good idea to start with the battery icons you find in your SystemUI.apk.<br />
	So you are sure you have all icons your ROM supports. And you have the correct filenames. Now replace these icons with your own designs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When you create your flashable-zip&hellip;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The Icons will <b>not</b> be renamed!<br />
	(So make sure filenames match your ROM!!!)</li>
	<li>The icons will be resized to the defined battery-height<br />
	(find it in Rom Settings)!</li>
	<li>The resized icons will be deployed to a subfolder<strong> ./png/deploy/Batteries/&lt;IconSetName&gt;</strong><br />
	(in case you want to look at the resized icons, or use them for something else)</li>
	<li>Finally the flashable-zip will be created!<br />
	(Find it in ./flashablezip-out/...)</li>
</ul>
