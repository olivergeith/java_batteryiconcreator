<h2 pbzloc="160">Weather&nbsp;Icon-Sets</h2>

<hr />
<p pbzloc="164">This is the right place, if you have&nbsp;custom weather icons from somewhere ( downloaded from the internet, self-designed...) and want to add them to your flashable-zip!<br />
You will find some predefined IconSets here, but you can add your own IconSets as well!<br />
The predefined Icon-Sets are for AOKP Rom&#39;s and will probably not work on Stock Rom&#39;s!</p>

<p pbzloc="153"><span pbzloc="154" style="color: #b22222"><strong pbzloc="149">Attention:</strong> Since AOKP / CM &nbsp;Android 4.1 and 4.2 the weather icons are gone from framework-res.apk!<br />
This feature is quiet useless for theres ROMS now...but it is still there (just in case ;-))<br />
So don&#39;t try to flash them, unless you are sure your ROM still has those icons!</span></p>

<p pbzloc="155">Make sure you have the correct Rom Settings before you create a flashable-zip!</p>

<p pbzloc="237"><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=38272787&amp;postcount=364" pbzloc="156">Learn how to find the correct Rom Settings for your ROM</a></p>

<h3 pbzloc="245">HowTo add your own IconSets:</h3>

<ul>
	<li pbzloc="139">Goto the folder where you extracted the &quot;Rom Fumbler&quot;</li>
	<li pbzloc="142">Find the subfolder<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace"><span style="color: #008000"> <strong pbzloc="270">./weather/</strong></span></span></li>
	<li pbzloc="271">See the predefined IconSets in there ?</li>
	<li>Create a new subfolder(s) next to the predefined IconSets. For example &quot;CoolWeatherIcons&quot;</li>
	<li>and place your custom png&#39;s in that new folder.</li>
	<li>That is all&hellip;after a restart of the Rom Fumbler you should see your IconSet in the dropdown box.</li>
	<li><b>Hint: </b>The Rom Fumbler will create an overview-png automaticly in your new subfolder on restart<br />
	(if you want to show of your creations ?)</li>
	<li><b>Hint: </b>So if you want to stay flexible it might be a good idea to put xhdpi icons in here, even if you are on a hdpi ROM.<br />
	(icons are resized to fit your ROM-Presets!)</li>
	<li pbzloc="272"><b>Hint: </b>If you create your own IconSet, it might be a good idea to start with the signal &amp; wifi icons you find in your framework-res.apk.<br />
	So you are sure you have all icons your ROM supports. And you have the correct filenames. Now replace these icons with your own designs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 pbzloc="246">When you create your flashable-zip&hellip;</h3>

<ul>
	<li pbzloc="248">The Icons will <b>not</b> be renamed!<br />
	(So make sure filenames match your ROM!!!)</li>
	<li pbzloc="273">The icons will be resized to the defined weather-height<br />
	(find it in Rom Settings)!</li>
	<li pbzloc="146">The resized icons will be deployed to a subfolder<span style="color: #008000"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace"><strong> ./png/deploy/Weather/&lt;IconSetName&gt;</strong></span></span><br />
	(in case you want to look at the resized icons, or use them for something else)</li>
	<li pbzloc="158">Finally the flashable-zip will be created!<br />
	(Find it in ./flashablezip-out/...)</li>
</ul>
