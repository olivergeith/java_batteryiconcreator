<h2 pbzloc="27">&nbsp;Signal and Wifi Icon-Sets</h2>

<hr /> What are we doing here ?
<hr pbzloc="234" />
<p pbzloc="232">This is the right place, if you have&nbsp;custom signal and/or&nbsp;wifi iconsfrom somewhere ( downloaded from the internet, self-designed...) and want to add them to your flashable-zip!<br />
<b pbzloc="233">Attention don&#39;t add rendered signal/wifi icons from &quot;Render-Tab&quot; too...you will probably get an error trying to create the zip! Because of duplicate filenames!</b><br />
You will find some predefined IconSets here, but you can add your own IconSets as well!<br />
The predefined Icon-Sets are for AOKP Rom&#39;s and will probably not work on Stock Rom&#39;s!</p>

<p pbzloc="244"><span style="color: #ff0000"><i>There is no guaranty that the predefined icons match your ROM. You need to analyse your <b>SystemUI.apk</b> first, to make sure the icons match the naming in your ROM! </i></span></p>

<p>Make sure you have the correct Rom Settings before you create a flashable-zip!</p>

<p pbzloc="237"><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=38272787&amp;postcount=364" pbzloc="105">Learn how to find the correct Rom Settings for your ROM</a></p>

<h3 pbzloc="245">HowTo add your own IconSets:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Goto the folder where you extracted the &quot;Rom Fumbler&quot;</li>
	<li pbzloc="100">Find the subfolder <span style="color: #008000"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace"><strong pbzloc="28">./custom/signalwifi/</strong></span></span></li>
	<li pbzloc="241">See the predefined IconSets in there ?</li>
	<li>Create a new subfolder(s) next to the predefined IconSets. For example &quot;CoolWifiIcons&quot;</li>
	<li>and place your custom png&#39;s in that new folder.</li>
	<li>That is all&hellip;after a restart of the Rom Fumbler you should see your IconSet in the dropdown box.</li>
	<li><b>Hint: </b>The Rom Fumbler will create an overview-png automaticly in your new subfolder on restart<br />
	(if you want to show of your creations ?)</li>
	<li><b>Hint: </b>So if you want to stay flexible it might be a good idea to put xhdpi icons in here, even if you are on a hdpi ROM.<br />
	(icons are resized to fit your ROM-Presets!)</li>
	<li pbzloc="242"><b>Hint: </b>If you create your own IconSet, it might be a good idea to start with the signal &amp; wifi icons you find in your SystemUI.apk.<br />
	So you are sure you have all icons your ROM supports. And you have the correct filenames. Now replace these icons with your own designs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 pbzloc="246">When you create your flashable-zip&hellip;</h3>

<ul>
	<li pbzloc="248">The Icons will <b>not</b> be renamed!<br />
	(So make sure filenames match your ROM!!!)</li>
	<li pbzloc="250">The icons will be resized to the defined battery-height (yes <strong>battery </strong>height...so all the statusbar icons match in height!)<br />
	(find it in Rom Settings)!</li>
	<li pbzloc="104">The resized icons will be deployed to a subfolder<strong> <span style="color: #008000"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace">./png/deploy/Signal&amp;Wifi/&lt;IconSetName&gt;</span></span></strong><br />
	(in case you want to look at the resized icons, or use them for something else)</li>
	<li>Finally the flashable-zip will be created!<br />
	(Find it in ./flashablezip-out/...)</li>
</ul>
