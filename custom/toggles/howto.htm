<h2 pbzloc="19">Toggle-IconSets!</h2>

<hr /> What are we doing here ?
<hr />
<p pbzloc="31">Here you can modify your Rom&#39;s toggle icons.<br />
Just choose a Toggle IconSet you like in the dropdown box!</p>

<p pbzloc="30">You will find some predefined Toggle-IconSets here, but you can add your own IconSets as well!<br />
The predefined Icon-Sets are mostly for AOKP. Watch out for the correct version.</p>

<ul pbzloc="17">
	<li>(AOKP) all up to Android 4.1.2</li>
	<li>(AOKP 4.2) for Android 4.2.1 and above!</li>
</ul>

<p pbzloc="37"><span style="color: #ff0000">There is no guaranty that the predefined icons match your ROM. You need to analyze your SystemUI.apk first, to make sure the icons match the naming in your ROM!</span></p>

<p>Make sure you have the correct Rom Settings before you create a flashable-zip!</p>

<p pbzloc="41"><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=38272787&amp;postcount=364" pbzloc="40">Learn how to find the correct Rom Settings for your ROM</a></p>

<h3 pbzloc="9">HowTo add your own IconSets:</h3>

<ul>
	<li pbzloc="42">Go to the folder where you extracted the &quot;Rom Fumbler&quot;</li>
	<li pbzloc="43">Find the subfolder <strong>./toggles/</strong></li>
	<li>See the predefined IconSets in there ?</li>
	<li>Create a new subfolder(s) next to the predefined IconSets. For example &quot;MySuperDuperToggles&quot;</li>
	<li>and place your custom toogle png&#39;s in that new folder.</li>
	<li pbzloc="50">That is all?after a restart of the Rom Fumbler you should see your IconSet in the dropdown box.</li>
	<li pbzloc="52"><strong>Hint:</strong> The Rom Fumbler will create an overview-png automaticly in your new subfolder on restart<br />
	(if you want to show of your creations ?)</li>
	<li pbzloc="54"><strong>Hint:</strong> So if you want to stay flexible it might be a good idea to put xhdpi icons in here, even if you are on a hdpi ROM.<br />
	(icons are resized to fit your ROM-Presets!)</li>
	<li pbzloc="55"><strong>Hint:</strong> If you create your own IconSet, it might be a good idea to start with the toggle icons you find in your SystemUI.apk.<br />
	So you are sure you have all icons your ROM supports. And you have the correct filenames. Now replace these icons with your own designs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 pbzloc="48">When you create your flashable-zip?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The Icons will not be renamed!<br />
	(So make sure filenames match your ROM!!!)</li>
	<li pbzloc="44">The icons will be resized to the toggle-height specified in Rom Settings</li>
	<li pbzloc="46">The resized icons will be deployed to a subfolder <strong>./png/deploy/toggles/&lt;IconSet&gt;</strong><br />
	(in case you want to look at the resized icons, or use them for something else)</li>
	<li pbzloc="47">Finally the flashable-zip will be created!<br />
	(Find it in <strong>./flashablezip-out/...</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<hr /> The predefined Toggles in here &quot;(AOKP...)&quot; are for AOKP-Roms only! Stock Roms have different filenames.<br />
Don&#39;t flash these to Stock Roms !!!!
