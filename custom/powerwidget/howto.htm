<h2 pbzloc="281">&nbsp;CM Powerwidget Toggle-IconSets!</h2>

<hr /> What are we doing here ?
<hr />
<p>This is the feature to add CM Powerwidget <b>Toggles</b> to your flashable-zip.<br />
The CM Powerwidget is an widget for the Notification-Panel.<br />
So if you activate it in CM, you have some extra toggles if you pull down the Notification Panel from your statusbar.<br />
Here you can choose different icons to be used for this widget.Just choose the IconSet you want in the dropdown box!</p>

<p>You will find some predefined -IconSets here, but you can add your own IconSets as well!<br />
The predefined Icon-Sets are mostly for CM and some AOKP Rom&#39;s like Rootbox.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><i>There is no guaranty that the predefined icons match your ROM. You need to analyse your <b>SystemUI.apk</b> first, to make sure the icons match the naming in your ROM! </i></span></p>

<p>Make sure you have the correct Rom Settings before you create a flashable-zip!</p>

<h3>HowTo add your own IconSets:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Goto the folder where you extracted the &quot;Rom Fumbler&quot;</li>
	<li>Find the subfolder ./powerwidget/</li>
	<li>See the predefined IconSets in there ?</li>
	<li>Create a new subfolder(s) next to the predefined IconSets. For example &quot;MySuperDuperToggles&quot;</li>
	<li>and place your custom toogle png&#39;s in that new folder.</li>
	<li>That is all&hellip;after a restart of the Rom Fumbler you should see your IconSet in the dropdown box.</li>
	<li><b>Hint: </b>The Rom Fumbler will create an overview-png automaticly in your new subfolder on restart<br />
	(if you want to show of your creations ?)</li>
	<li><b>Hint: </b>So if you want to stay flexible it might be a good idea to put xhdpi icons in here, even if you are on a hdpi ROM.<br />
	(icons are resized to fit your ROM-Presets!)</li>
	<li><b>Hint: </b>If you create your own IconSet, it might be a good idea to start with the toggle icons you find in your SystemUI.apk.<br />
	So you are sure you have all icons your ROM supports. And you have the correct filenames. Now replace these icons with your own designs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When you create your flashable-zip&hellip;</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The Icons will not be renamed!<br />
	(So make sure filenames match your ROM!!!)</li>
	<li>The icons will be resized to the defined toggle-height<br />
	(find it in Rom Settings)!</li>
	<li>The resized icons will be deployed to a subfolder ./png/deploy/PowerWidgetToggles/&lt;IconSet&gt;<br />
	(in case you want to look at the resized icons, or use them for something else)</li>
	<li>Finally the flashable-zip will be created!<br />
	(Find it in ./flashablezip-out/...)</li>
</ul>
