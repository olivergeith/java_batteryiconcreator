<b><big>CM Powerwidget Toggle-IconSets!</big></b>
<hr>
What are we doing here ?
<hr>
This is the feature to add CM Powerwidget <b>Toggles</b> to your flashable-zip. 
<br>The CM Powerwidget is an widget for the Notification-Panel. So if you activate it in CM, you have some extra toggles if you pull down the Notification Panel from your statusbar. So here you can choose different icons to be used for this widget.<br>Just choose the IconSet you want in the dropdown box!
<br>You will find some predefined -IconSets here, but you can add your own IconSets as well!<br>The predefined Icon-Sets are mostly for CM and some AOKP Rom's like Rootbox.<br><br><i>There is no guaranty that the predefined icons match your ROM. You need to analyse your <b>SystemUI.apk</b> first, to make sure the icons match the naming in your ROM!
<br></i><br>Make sure you have the correct Rom Settings before you create a flashable-zip!<br>
<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=38272787&postcount=364">Learn how to find the correct Rom Settings for your ROM</a>
<br><br>
<b><big>HowTo add your own IconSets:</big></b>
<ul>
<li>Goto the folder where you extracted the &quot;Rom Fumbler&quot;</li>
<li>Find the subfolder ./powerwidget/</li>
<li>See the predefined IconSets in there ?</li>
<li>Create a new subfolder(s) next to the predefined IconSets. For example "MySuperDuperToggles"</li> 
<li>and place your custom toogle png's in that new folder.</li>
<li>That is all…after a restart of the Rom Fumbler you should see your IconSet in the dropdown box.</li>
<li><b>Hint: </b>The Rom Fumbler will create an overview-png automaticly in your new subfolder on restart <br>(if you want to show of your creations ?)</li>
<li><b>Hint: </b>So if you want to stay flexible it might be a good idea to put xhdpi icons in here, even if you are on a hdpi ROM. <br>(icons are resized to fit your ROM-Presets!)</li>
<li><b>Hint: </b>If you create your own IconSet, it might be a good idea to start with the toggle icons you find in your SystemUI.apk. So you are sure you have all icons your ROM supports. And you have the correct filenames. Now replace these icons with your own designs.</li>
</ul>
<b><big>When you create your flashable-zip…</big></b>
<ul>
<li>The Icons will not be renamed! <br>(So make sure filenames match your ROM!!!)</li>
<li>The icons will be resized to the defined toggle-height <br>(find it in Rom Settings)!</li>
<li>The resized icons will be deployed to a subfolder ./png/deploy/toggles/&lt;IconSet&gt;  <br>(in case you want to look at the resized icons, or use them for something else)</IconSet>
<li>Finally the flashable-zip will be created!
<br>(Find it in ./flashablezip-out/...)
</ul>
