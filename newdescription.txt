[COLOR="navy"][SIZE="6"][B][CENTER]The Battery Icon Creator & Rom Fumbler[/CENTER][/B][/SIZE][/COLOR]

[SIZE="4"][B]History or why did I develop this tool?:[/B][/SIZE]
I was fed up, with designing my battery icons with a painttool. 204 icons per set is a lot work, if you do it manually!
As I mostly did abstract and simple icons to be in harmony with AOKP, I had the idea, to develop a little Java tool to do the work for me ;)
Now it has grown up and much more was added. (I should think about a new Name? :)) 


[SIZE="4"][B][CENTER]So here is: ...[/CENTER][/B][/SIZE]

[SIZE="4"][B]Changelog:[/B][/SIZE]
[COLOR="Blue"][B]Nov-15-2012[/B] : Release 15.0[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*]Some Batteries (ArcBattery2...) can now be configured to have NO grey backround
[*]Create and Zip button back on top right corner of the frame
[*]New: [B][COLOR="Green"]Real Circle Animation[/COLOR][/B] during charge...very Cool...like Jkay Mod!!! But only for RR and maybe other AOKP-Roms!

[*]4 new Battery styles and some old optimized

[*]Advanced stuff is now hidden by default..."Noobs keep away" Messagebox, when activated. (Activate advanced stuff with new button in buttonbar)
[/LIST]

These new [B]"Theme" and "Fileset" Features[/B] make it possible, to create addons to your Rom. Flash them with only [B]one flashable zip[/B]!
For example you can flash your Battery-Icons along with themed icons for almost any other app. And you cann add additional apk's, media, libs, data...
Personally I use this to flash the Android 4.2 Camera along with my prefered battery and lockring...as an example.

But be carefull this is a very advanced features. You should know how your rom looks from the inside! You need to be familiar with directory structures in a rom and in its apk's and so on...
[SIZE="4"][COLOR="DarkRed"][B]Noobs keep away from those new features!!![/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]

[SIZE="4"][B]Todo:[/B][/SIZE]
[LIST]
[*]Bugfixing
[*]Make the Style-Modules even more customizable
[*]Creating new styles
[*]Supporting other apk's (any suggestions?)
[*]And finally....A lot of things that you might come up with ;)
[/LIST]

[SIZE="4"][B]HowTo - General[/B][/SIZE]
This tool is written in pure Java. So the only thing you need to have is a Java Runtime 1.6 or 1.7.
[LIST]
[*]Download the zip attached to this Post
[*]Unzip the tool to any directory
[*]Step into that directory
[*]Doubleclick in the Jar-file
[*]...or use the start.bat
[*]Choose Battery Design (Combobox in Buttonbar)
[*]Choose Wifi Design (Combobox in Buttonbar)
[*]Choose Signal Design (Combobox in Buttonbar)
[*]Choose any other iconset you want to add
[*]Choose your ROM in Rom Presets Dropdown (Default values are for xhdpi Roms like Resurrection Remix 3.x.x)
[*]Create your images (Play-Button)
[*]...play with resize-option and algorithm to get best results
[*]...the Tool will create a new folder "pngs" in the above directory
[*]...find your Icons in there...
[*]Or (when you are satisfied with your settings) create a flashable Zip (Button next to Playbutton)
[*]...find the Zip in the "flashablezip_out"-folder
[/LIST]

[SIZE="4"][B]HowTo - Is my ROM supported?[/B][/SIZE]
For a Rom to be supported, it needs to have a 1% battery mod!
Samsung Stock Roms don't have this until a Mod like JKay is applied.
CM10 Roms like the official nightlies or Paranoidandroid don't have this either. 
I am sure there are some Mod's out there that will do the trick with these Roms...

If your ROM has a 1% Mod, there are only a few things you need to investigate, to find the correct Settings for my tool.
You need to...
[LIST]
[*]extract the SystemUI.apk from your Rom (look in the flashabel zip of your Rom, 
[*}or use your phone and navigate with EsExplorer or Root-Explorer to /system/app and find SystemUI.apk there and 
[*]...copy it to your internal or external SD card, so you can access the file from your Computer
[*]Open SystemUI.apk with 7Zip and navigate to ...
[*]...res\drawable-<xxxx> and find the rom's original 1% battery icons in there
[*]remember the folder you found your png's in. (normally [B]drawable-hdpi or drawable-xhdpi[/B])
[*]see how the Files are named. (something like [B]stat_sys_battery_circle_charge_anim<percentage>.png[/B])
[*]check the height of the original png's
[*]now you got everything to choose the correct settings in the Battery Icon Creator
[*]...drawable-Folder
[*]...naming convention/pattern of png's
[*]...icon height
[/LIST]
If you found your settings, please let me know, what settings, what ROM you used. 
So I can add the ROM to my compatibility list and add predefined Settings to the tool itself.

[SIZE="4"][B]HowTo - Toggles...your own, custom toggles[/B][/SIZE]
Same procedure with weather icons...but they are located in framework-res.apk
[LIST]
[*]Same procedure as above to analyse SystemUI.apk 
[*}...find the toggle icons in there 
[*]...copy toggles into a new folder under ./custom/toggles/<setname> 
[*]......eg ./custom/toggles/MySuperDuperToggles
[*]......next to my predifined Togglesets!
[*]Hint: it might be a good idea to create another folder in there with the untouched original toggle icons from your Rom's SystemUI.apk
[*]......eg ./custom/toggles/MyOriginalToggles
[*]...for AOKP Roms there are normally 36 icons named like toggle_*.png
[*]...edit the toggles with some Paint-Tool ore replace them with some completely new toggles(maybe you downloaded some from the internet)
[*]...make sure you have the correct filenames of your toggles (filenames need to be exactly like in your SystemUI.apk)
[*]Start The Battery Icon Creator and find your Toggleset in the Dropdownbox there...
[*]choose your Toggleset and create your flaschable zip
