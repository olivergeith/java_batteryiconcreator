<h2 pbzloc="104">This is the Battery Renderer</h2>

<hr />
<p>The <strong>Battery Renderer </strong>is the main feature in the Rom Fumbler. There are lots of styles to select from in the dropdown box above.<br />
The Renderer creates your battery-icons with graphical and mathmatical algorithms. There are no prestored battery icons!<br />
The Icons are created/calculated online, when you press the play-button.</p>

<p>On the left hand side you find all the battery settings you can play with. So please play with the settings and check out what happens :-)</p>

<h3>Saving and restoring Battery Settings</h3>

<p pbzloc="139">Every battery style has its own set of Battery Settings! ...and its own predefinitions within the Battery Settings when you start the Rom Fumbler.<br />
After you made your modifications, you can save your settings and later restore them. You can even restore them to another style! (This may not always be usefull :-) )</p>

<p>Settings are not stored automaticly on program exit...so if you tweaked a lot of stuff, than you should save the battery settings and load them when you start the Rom Fumbler again!</p>

<p pbzloc="112">You can save and load these settings with the two buttons on the left.</p>

<h3 pbzloc="115">Rom Settings</h3>

<p pbzloc="122">Rom Settings also contribute to your battery icons. In Rom Settings you set</p>

<ul pbzloc="135">
	<li pbzloc="123">the icon height</li>
	<li pbzloc="124">naming pattern of the icons</li>
	<li pbzloc="125">resizing options (smart resize)</li>
	<li pbzloc="130">the drawable folder used in the flashable-zip</li>
</ul>

<h3 pbzloc="126">Charge icons</h3>

<p>The dropdownbox with charge icons has some icons that are compiled into the Java jar. But you can add your own icons as well.</p>

<p>Look at the subfolder<strong> ./custom/charge/... </strong>and put your additional charge icons in there and restart the Rom Fumbler. The icons must be transparent png&#39;s! (No gif, no jpg...!)</p>

<h3>Overview &amp; Listview</h3>

<p>The overview shows the overview-png, that is created and saved every time you press the play-button on the top right side! (Like the 200+ battery-png&#39;s)<br />
This overvies and the battery png&#39;s&nbsp;is stored in a subfolder of the Rom Fumbler ./pngs/&lt;batterystylename&gt;/overview*</p>

<p>So if you want the png&#39;s only and no flashable zip...then look in that subfolder(s)!</p>

<p>The Listview is usefull if you want to check out how the icons animate...just scroll up and down slowly!</p>

<h3>Fonts</h3>

<p pbzloc="107">The Font Chooser shows all your computers system fonts. So if you want more fonts, install them on your system.</p>

<ul>
	<li pbzloc="108">Lots of nice free ttf&nbsp;fonts <a href="http://www.dafont.com/">can be found here</a></li>
	<li pbzloc="111">The original Android Roboto ttf <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1315328" pbzloc="110">can be found here</a></li>
