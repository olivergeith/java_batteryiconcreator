<h1>Things you need to know</h1>
<h2>1. Thing to know: Every Battery has its own settings</h2>
<p>This programm is an App that has grown a lott. First it was -as the name 
says- only an editor for battery icons. Every battery style had and still has 
its own set of settings. Even the &quot;No Batt Icons&quot; style. When the App grew up...the 
settings were growing too with all that stuff you need for Wifi and Signal icons 
filenames for lockhandle and so on. All this is stored within the settings of 
the chosen battery style.</p>
<p>The consequence is, if you choose another battery style, you have to do your 
adjustments for wifi and so on again. Most important you have to set your Rom 
presets again for the new battery style! Don't forget that, or you might end up 
with a flashable zip that does nothing but adding icons to systemui and 
framework-res in the wrong drawable folder!!!</p>
<p>The pro on this is: </p>
<ul>
  <li>You can store all settings in one file</li>
  <li>You can have different settings for each battery style</li>
  <li>you can even restore settings from for example ArcBattery to AOKP battery 
  and all your colorsettings are the same</li>
</ul>
<p>What is not stored in settings is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>what kind of Wifi style or signal style you chose</li>
  <li>what weather iconset you chose</li>
  <li>what lockhandle you chose</li>
  <li>what toggles you chose</li>
  <li>how transparent your notification area should be</li>
  <li>what charge icon you chose (this might be stored in some future 
  Version..ist mor or less a low prio bug ;-))</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Thing to know: No xml modding by this App</h2>
<p>This tool dos not mod any xml files within your roms apk's! It most likely 
will never do this!<br>
The only thing it does is replacing png's! And flashing files (if you use the 
fileset feature</p>
<p>This makes all your flashable zips compatible for every version or 
incarnation of your rom! No need to create a new zip for every nightly of your 
rom. As long as the dev of you rom does not change from lets say xhdpi to hdpi 
the mods will be compatible &quot;forever&quot;. The will even work on other roms with 
same dpi!</p>
<h2>3. Thing to know: 1% battery mod must be in your rom</h2>
<p>Your rom needs to have a 1% battery mod to be compatible. The tool creates 
204 png's for the 1% battery. 0 to 100% for charging and discharging and 2 &quot;full&quot; 
icons.  </p>
<p>All AOKP have a battery circle mod (find it in Settings -&gt; Rom Control -&gt; Battery) This 
is what my tool will use and replace the 204 icons for it.</p>
<p>Stock roms normally don't have a 1% mod unless you install a mod like JKay! 
<b>Attention</b> the pngs for JKay are named slightly different then the ones in AOKP. 
You can choose the right names with the Rom-Presets.</p>
<p>CM10 does not have a 1% mod! So it is not compatible! <br>
Since late Oktober 2012 they have a circle battery mod to, <b>but this is very different,</b> 
as it has no 204 png's. It renders the icon online with a grafical algorithm 
like my tool does. Perhaps it will later have different online renderred battery 
styles...who knows...there definately is potential!</p>
<h2>4. Thing to know: Custom Area</h2>
<p>When you install the Battery Icon Creator by unzipping it to some folder, you 
also unzip the custom area of this tool. This is where you can put your own 
icons to be used by this tool to create flashable zips. Each aspect you can 
customize has its own subfolder in this custom area! Feel free to explore this 
area, you will find out how it works. And I provided a few predefined custom 
icons...so it will be easy to understand how to add your own stuff!</p>
