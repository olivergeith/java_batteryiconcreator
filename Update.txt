All default Rom-Settings in this tool are still for AOKP-Roms and HDPI-Devices like S2-i9100. (for example RootBox i9100) 
As I am part of the Rootbox-Team now, it will probably stay like this for a very long time now ;-)
...so, I will make sure Rootbox is best supported by the Rom-Fumbler ;-) 
This Version adds support for CM Powerwidget Toggles in Rootbox!

Happy modding & flashing :)
