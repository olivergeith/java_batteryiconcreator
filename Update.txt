[B][SIZE="3"]New Version out of [URL="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1918500"]"The Rom Fumbler" aka "The Battery Icon Creator"[/URL][/SIZE][/B]

[SIZE="4"][B]Changelog:[/B][/SIZE]
[COLOR="Blue"][B]March-10-2013[/B] : Release 21.0[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*]Better default charge-icons
[*]New predefined Signal & Wifi Icon-Set (V6)
[*]Updated and polished 4.2 Toggle-Icon-Sets (V8...new tiles like Pie and so on....)
[*]New Tacho Battery Style
[*]New Option to add "%" to the Level-Numbers
[*]New Option to add a glow behind the numbers
[*]More and better Support for Rootbox (You can now create flashable-zips for overwriting all 3 CircleMods of Rootbox):
[*]....support for new Rootbox Speedometer Battery (choose corresponding RomPreset!)
[*]....support for new Rootbox Square Battery (choose corresponding RomPreset!)
[*]....default settings will overwrite the "normal CircleMod" now also known as "Rootbox Circle"
[*]Selectable Morphpath to framework-res implemented ... /preload/.... now possible (may help on stock Sammy JB ?!?!...but still no official support!)
[/LIST]

All default Rom-Settings in this tool are still for AOKP-Roms and HDPI-Devices like S2-i9100. (for example RootBox i9100) 
As I am part of the Rootbox-Team now, it will probably stay like this for a very long time now ;-)
...so, I will make sure Rootbos is best supported by the Rom-Fumbler ;-) 

Happy modding & flashing :)
