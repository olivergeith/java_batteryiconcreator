[SIZE="4"][B]Changelog:[/B][/SIZE]
[COLOR="Blue"][B]April-26-2013[/B] : Release 23.0[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*]Custom Battery Iconsets (with resizing to fit your ROM, but without renaming...so make sure filenames match your ROM!) 
[*]....Maybe I will add some kind of optional renaming later ?!
[*]....If you use this wisely, you can add all the Rootbox battery Mods into one single flashable-zip ;)
[*]....New predifined Battery Icon-Sets (add your own icon-Sets in ./custom/battery/...)
[*]HowTo-Tabs with infos, help and links in most of the "main features"
[*]Gui re-arranged to group "Renderes" and "Icon-Sets"...
[*]Combobox for drawable folder now editable (in case you have a rare dpi like ldpi or something)
[*]New predefined Powerwidget Toggle Icon-Sets. (More consistent to the normal Tile-Toggles in Rootbox)
[*]Adding Support for Emoticon Iconsets
[*]...flashabel to framework-res.apk or mms.apk (See Rom Settings)
[*]...Predefined Emoticon Iconsets (add your own to /custom/emoticons/...)
[*]optimized folder-structure unter ./pngs/...
[*]New Signal and Wifi Styles in Renderer
[*]...one of them inspired by the idea of my daughter Emmylou :-)
[/LIST]

All default Rom-Settings in this tool are still for AOKP-Roms and HDPI-Devices like S2-i9100. (for example RootBox i9100) 
As I am part of the Rootbox-Team now, it will probably stay like this for a very long time now ;-)
...so, I will make sure Rootbox is best supported by the Rom-Fumbler ;-) 

Happy modding & flashing :)
