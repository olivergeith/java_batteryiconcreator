[SIZE="4"][B]Changelog:[/B][/SIZE]
[COLOR="Blue"][B]May-13-2013[/B] : Release 25.0[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*]A lot of changes in Rom Settings and Rom Presets
[*]...Rom Presets are no longer hard coded! Now stored in plain textfiles in ./rompresets/...
[*]...Rom Settings can be exported into a Rom Preset (available in dropdownbox after restart)
[*]...if you created a Rom Preset for your Rom...share it and upload it here...I will add it to the next version!
[*]...colored icons in the RomPreset-dropdownbox...parses the name and if it finds something like "i9100" or "i9300" it uses special icons
[*]Support for VRTheme Templates
[*]...new vrtheme template...
[*]Support for /preload partition in Samsung Galaxy S2 Stock Roms (Still WIP...but some things already work)
[*]...another new vrtheme template, that supports the /preload partition (Seems to work!)
[*]...new UniversalFlasher template for /preload  (Need someone to test this!!!!) 
[*]Global Settings
[*]...define what Rom Preset to apply on startup of the Rom Fumbler!
[*]...by this you can overwrite the (hdpi)defaults to your needs!!! This should bring relief to all "non S2" Users ;-)
[*]...define if you want to see the Advanced Button in Toolbar (by default it is invisible) Turn it on here and restart Rom Fumbler!
[*]Help-pages for Rom Settings and Global Settings 
[*]...read them carefully, in case you want to add your own Rom Presets or Templates...
[*]New Battery Renderer
[*]...new Faecher.Wide Battery
[*]Support vor xxhdpi like in Galaxy S4
[*]...Some Battery Renderers already render in xxhdpi without resizing! (the white ones in the chooser dropdownbox)
[*]...watch for tooltips in the above dropdownbox :-)
[*]New Rom Preset for Note 2 Labrats Rom
[*]Animator at the bottom of the Battery, Wifi and Signal Renderer...see how your icons animate, when played in sequence!

Happy modding & flashing :)
